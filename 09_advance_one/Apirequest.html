<!-- xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){ ... }
This event handler runs every time the request state changes.
xhr.readyState has values:
0: UNSENT → request not initialized
1: OPENED → open() called
2: HEADERS_RECEIVED → response headers received
3: LOADING → downloading response (partial data)
4: DONE → request completed
You’re logging the state each time to track progress. -->
